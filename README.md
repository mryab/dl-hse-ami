# Deep Learning

This repository contains materials of the Deep Learning course taught at
the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://cs.hse.ru/en/) of [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/).

Details about the course organization can be found at
the [wiki page](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_2022) (in Russian).
